							<h2>Com Thit Nuong</h2>
							<p>Fact: A grilled pork and broken rice plate? Yes, please! Asian cuisine, especially Vietnamese cuisine, focuses on a balance of “heats” on a single dish.

							<h2>Agedashi Tofu 揚げ出し豆腐</h2>
							<p>Fact: Agedashi tofu, meaning “lightly deep-fried tofu”. The cubed tofu achieves its crunchy-chewy skin from cornstarch or potato starch and is served in a tentsuyu, a broth combining dashi, mirin, and Japanese soy sauce. The dish is finally garnished with shredded seaweed and negi, green onions. <br><br>Pro tip: It’s difficult for the tofu to fully absorb the flavors of the tensuyu through the skin, so break the skin a bit at the top and scoop some of the tentsuyu into the tofu. With the deep fried skin holding the broth and tofu together, you have a little water bomb of flavors. </p>
