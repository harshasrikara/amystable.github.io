 <h2>Tsukemen つけめん Dipping Ramen</h2> 
 <p>Fact: One of the more recent ramen variations to be created, tsukemen was created in the 1950s by 17 year old Kazuo Yamagishi while he was a ramen chef apprentice. Tsukemen is characterized by its thicker ramen noodles that absorb the dipping broth; the thicker broth; and the benefit of not having soggy noodles which some regular ramen eaters face if they let the noodles sit in the broth.<br><br>Pro tip: I love eating ramen eggs (ajitsuke tamago/ 味付け玉子) with tsukemen to have that added yolky flavor. Also add bamboo shoots!</p>
