 <h2>Chả Cá Lã Vọng (Vietnamese Turmeric Fish with Dill)</h2> 
 <p>Fact: This fried fish dish is one of the signature dishes of Hanoi. The dish consists of little fish fillets that are marinated in turmeric and galangal before being fried and served with rice noodles and dill.<br><br>Pro tip: Eat this with mắm ruốc, fermented shrimp paste. I love putting my rice noodles on the skillet, putting a bit of mắm ruốc on the skillet, and then mixing the noodles with the paste, the dill and seasoning of the fish on the skillet. </p>
