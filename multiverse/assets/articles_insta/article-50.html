 <h2>Crying Tiger Suea Rong Hai (Thai Grilled Steak with Salad and Sticky Rice)</h2> 
 <p>Fact: There are two theories as to why the dish is called Crying Tiger: 1. Back then, really old meat was used and would be so tough that the tiger wouldn’t be able to chew it, and then the tiger would be all sad and weepy. 2. The meat used is so tender and marbled that all that’s left for the tiger is the undesirable cuts of meat, leaving the tiger sad and weepy. <br><br>Pro tip: Drizzle a bit of the chili sauce on the sticky rice and eat it with the steak.</p>
