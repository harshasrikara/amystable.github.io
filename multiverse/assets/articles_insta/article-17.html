 <h2>Katsu Curry カツカレー with seaweed salad</h2> 
 <p>Fact: Curry was introduced to Japan during the Meiji Period (1868-1912) by Britain which had a presence in India at the time. Since then, Japanese cuisine had adopted the Indian curry and transformed it into its version. Katsu curry is fried pork cutlets and curry, served with rice. (Wikipedia)<br><br>Pro tip: Don’t eat the components of the dish separately. Pour the curry on the katsu and rice, and eat it together. </p>
