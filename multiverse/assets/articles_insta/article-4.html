 <p>Fact: A grilled pork and broken rice plate? Yes, please! Asian cuisine, especially Vietnamese cuisine, focuses on a balance of “heats” on a single dish. The pork and the egg are the hotter, heavier, and more savory components of the dish while, the cucumbers and pickled carrots and daikon combat the heat with the cooler, sweet, and sour flavors. This way, the dish never gets boring to the palate. <br><br>Pro tip: Don’t skip the pickles and cucumbers! The way to do it is eat the pickles and pork together.</p>
