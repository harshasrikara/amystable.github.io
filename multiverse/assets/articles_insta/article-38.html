 <h2>Sweet Shrimp 甘い海老 and Sea Urchin 海胆 </h2> 
 <p>Fact: These sweet shrimp, also known as spot prawns, are famous for the sweet taste and are popularly eaten raw to preserve that sweetness. Sea urchins have an incredibly creamy texture and flavor but are tremendously hard to harvest, making them a rarer delicacy.<br><br>Pro tip: Yes, you can deep-fry the shrimp heads to eat, but remember to eat from the back forward to avoid being poked by the legs and whiskers from the front. </p>
